                The best learning experience.
            </h1>
            <p>The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources. Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway. This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.</p>

                <p>TOP was a perfect match for my learning style. Not walking me through an entire project but actually forcing me to figure it out on my own, by pointing me in all the right directions in order to complete them. That helped me dig deeper into various important topics, which then gave me the necessary knowledge and confidence to start applying for jobs and landing that dream job. The community was part of it too, first getting help and then helping, it was a great way to learn and make it stick.</p>
